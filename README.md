Intensive coding bootcamp focusing on low-level programming, algorithms, and peer-to-peer learning methodology.

## Philosophy

Design has always been my first love, but I quickly realized I wouldn't be satisfied just executing someone else's vision. The binary nature of computers attracted me - things either work, or they don't, and when they don't, you can fix it. I found harmony between design thinking and binary logic, realizing how my creative thinking became a significant asset in programming.
